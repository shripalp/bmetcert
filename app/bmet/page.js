          Examination proctors are engaged at a location close to the
          candidate's home, or work. The time and date of an examination is
          negotiated between the candidate and the proctor. Once the mutually
          agreeable date has been set, the Board of Examiners' Secretariat
          prepares the examination documents and has them shipped to the proctor
          in good time for the examination. The candidate's examination results
          are usually available within four to six weeks of writing.
